= Contact Methods for Salt Clients

// FIXME describe here in a general way how Salt and SUMA work together
// (instead of rhnsd / osad)

If you need to use Salt clients in a disconnected setup you can configure Push via Salt SSH.
In this environment, clients are located in a firewall-protected zone called a DMZ.
For more information about this contact method, see xref:client-configuration:contact-methods-saltssh.adoc[].
